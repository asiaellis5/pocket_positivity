## Pocket Positivity

#### A Native app built with React Native and Expo built in a 3 day Hackathon to help Key Workers!

As a Team this was an entirely new tech stack which had been rapidly learned and implemented over the last two and a half days. In order to aid the project management we utilised a few techniques:

- Pair programming
- Mobbing to eleviate blockers
- Trello board for managing learning resources, ToDo, Completed etc.
